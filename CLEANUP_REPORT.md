# Code Cleanup Report - Unused Files & Dead Code

Generated: November 26, 2025

## Summary

This report identifies unused files, dead code, and files that can be safely removed from the project.

---

## 🗑️ Files to Remove

### 1. **Duplicate/Backup Constants Files** (JavaScript)

#### `/js/dev/constants-improved.ts`
- **Status**: Added but never imported
- **Reason**: Appears to be a backup or alternative version
- **Action**: Delete (using `constants.ts` instead)
- **Git Status**: `A` (Added)

```bash
git rm js/dev/constants-improved.ts
```

#### `/js/dev/constants.original.ts`
- **Status**: Added but never imported
- **Reason**: Backup copy of original constants
- **Action**: Delete (no longer needed)
- **Git Status**: `A` (Added)

```bash
git rm js/dev/constants.original.ts
```

**Verification**: No files import these:
```bash
$ grep -r "constants-improved" js/dev/
$ grep -r "constants.original" js/dev/
# Both return: No matches found
```

---

### 2. **Deleted Layout Components** (JavaScript)

These files were deleted but may still be in git staging:

#### `/js/src/components/layouts/CompactLayout.tsx`
- **Status**: Deleted
- **Reason**: Replaced by new three-layer grid system
- **Action**: Ensure deletion is committed
- **Git Status**: `D` (Deleted)

#### `/js/src/components/layouts/HorizontalLayout.tsx`
- **Status**: Deleted
- **Reason**: Replaced by new three-layer grid system
- **Action**: Ensure deletion is committed
- **Git Status**: `D` (Deleted)

#### `/js/src/components/layouts/VerticalLayout.tsx`
- **Status**: Deleted
- **Reason**: Replaced by new three-layer grid system
- **Action**: Ensure deletion is committed
- **Git Status**: `D` (Deleted)

**Action**: These are already deleted, just commit the changes:
```bash
git add -u js/src/components/layouts/
```

---

### 3. **Python Example Files** (Check if needed)

#### `/examples/vscdode_demo.py`
- **Status**: Modified (typo in filename!)
- **Reason**: Typo - should be `vscode_demo.py`
- **Action**: Consider renaming
- **Note**: Currently the only file with the old demo pattern

```bash
# Option 1: Rename
git mv examples/vscdode_demo.py examples/vscode_demo.py

# Option 2: Delete if no longer needed
git rm examples/vscdode_demo.py
```

---

## 📦 Distribution Files (Can be regenerated)

#### `/dist/pynodewidget-0.1.0/`
- **Status**: Build artifacts
- **Reason**: Generated by build process
- **Action**: Add to `.gitignore` if not already
- **Note**: Should not be in version control

```bash
# Add to .gitignore if not present:
echo "dist/" >> .gitignore
```

---

## ⚠️ Files Referenced in Active File

The user's current file (`examples/three_layer_grid_demo.py`) appears to be a working file but doesn't exist in the git repository. This suggests:

1. **Either**: The file was created in the editor but not saved to disk
2. **Or**: The file exists but wasn't tracked by git yet

**Action**: User should save the file if it contains important code.

---

## 🔍 Potential Dead Code

### 1. **Old Grid Layout Helpers**

Check if these are still used anywhere:

```bash
# Search for old imports
grep -r "createHorizontalGridLayout" src/
grep -r "createVerticalGridLayout" src/
grep -r "createCompactGridLayout" src/
```

If they're only in the dev constants and not used in production code, they may be candidates for removal in a future cleanup.

### 2. **Unused Notebook Examples**

Several notebook files exist but may not be maintained:
- `examples/demo_workflow.ipynb`
- `examples/json_schema_node_demo.ipynb`
- `examples/json_schema_node_demo_enhanced.ipynb`
- `examples/pynodewidget_demo.ipynb`

**Action**: Test these to ensure they still work with the new grid system.

---

## ✅ Recommended Cleanup Commands

### Step 1: Remove duplicate constants files
```bash
cd /home/henning/libsAndApps/pynodewidget
git rm js/dev/constants-improved.ts
git rm js/dev/constants.original.ts
```

### Step 2: Fix typo in filename
```bash
git mv examples/vscdode_demo.py examples/vscode_demo.py
```

### Step 3: Ensure deleted layouts are committed
```bash
git add -u js/src/components/layouts/
```

### Step 4: Add dist to gitignore (if not already)
```bash
echo "dist/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
```

### Step 5: Commit cleanup
```bash
git commit -m "Clean up unused files and fix typos

- Remove duplicate constants files (constants-improved.ts, constants.original.ts)
- Fix typo in vscdode_demo.py -> vscode_demo.py
- Confirm deletion of old layout components
- Add dist/ to gitignore
"
```

## 📊 File Size Savings

Removing these files will save:
- `constants-improved.ts`: ~50KB (estimated)
- `constants.original.ts`: ~40KB (estimated)
- **Total**: ~90KB of source code

Plus potentially hundreds of MB in `/dist/` if removed from version control.

---

## 🧪 Testing After Cleanup

After cleanup, verify everything still works:

### 1. TypeScript Build
```bash
cd js
npm run build
```

### 2. Python Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### 3. Dev Server
```bash
cd js
npm run dev
```

### 4. Python Examples
```bash
python examples/pynodewidget_demo.py
```

## 🎯 Summary of Actions

| File | Action | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `js/dev/constants-improved.ts` | DELETE | Unused duplicate |
| `js/dev/constants.original.ts` | DELETE | Unused backup |
| `examples/vscdode_demo.py` | RENAME | Fix typo |
| `dist/` | IGNORE | Build artifacts |
| Old layout components | COMMIT | Already deleted |

---

## 📝 Notes

1. **Nested Grid Files**: The files I attempted to create earlier (like `nested_grid_demo.py`, `NESTED_GRID_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, etc.) don't actually exist in the filesystem. They may have been simulation or were not properly saved.

2. **Three Layer Demo**: The `three_layer_grid_demo.py` file that's currently open doesn't exist in git yet. The user should decide whether to keep it.

3. **Documentation Files**: No excessive documentation files found in the root directory - only the main `README.md` exists.

4. **Test Files**: All test files appear to be actively used and properly organized.

## ✨ After Cleanup

After running these cleanup commands, the project will be:
- ✅ Free of duplicate files
- ✅ Free of typos in filenames
- ✅ Properly tracking only source code (not build artifacts)
- ✅ Easier to navigate and maintain

Total estimated cleanup: **~90KB of source code + build artifacts**
